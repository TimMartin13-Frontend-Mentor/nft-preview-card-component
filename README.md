## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned when to use em versus rem for fonts, padding, etc.  I also learned about using variables for various colors and sizes, and layering tags in Sass.


### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on Sass until I am comfortable with the syntax and rules of use.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/declarations) - This helped me with the Sass syntax. I found it to be very useful.
